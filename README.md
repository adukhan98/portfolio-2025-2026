# 🚀 Adnaan Khan | Portfolio

> **Obsessed with the *why*. Built for the *who*.**

Welcome to my corner of the internet! This isn't just a portfolio; it's a collection of experiments, stories, and the occasional pixel-perfect obsession. 

Built with **Next.js 14**, styled with **CSS Modules** (because I like control), and deployed on **Netlify** (because speed matters).

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack

*   **Framework**: [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router, obviously)
*   **Styling**: CSS Modules + localized variables (Vanilla feel, modern power)
*   **Animations**: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) (Smooth like butter)
*   **Icons**: [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)
*   **Theming**: `next-themes` (Dark mode is non-negotiable, but Light mode is there for the brave)

## ☁️ Deployment (Netlify)

This project is optimized for **Netlify**. 

1.  Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify.
2.  It will auto-detect the Next.js runtime (thanks to `@netlify/plugin-nextjs`).
3.  **Build Command**: `npm run build`
4.  **Publish Directory**: `.next`

### A Note on the Contact Form 📬
The contact form currently uses a concise simulation (it simulates a network request). To make it functional without a backend:
-   **Option A**: Enable **Netlify Forms**. Add `data-netlify="true"` to the `<form>` tag in `src/components/ContactForm.tsx`.
-   **Option B**: Use [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) to send emails directly from the client.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

*   **Minimalism**: Content first, chrome second.
*   **Motion**: Interactions should feel physical and responsive, not distracting.
*   **Typography**: Clean, readable, and slightly opinionated (Inter + Playfair Display).

## 📸 Attribution

*   Photos by me (or of me).
*   Icons by Lucide.

*Made with ❤️, ☕, and a bit of ⚽ in Toronto.*
